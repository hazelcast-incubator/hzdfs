# Hazelcast - Distributed Filesystem

The Implementation will be done in different steps.

## Step 001
The first step will implement the HZFile. With this you are able to store single files inside a HZ cluster.
There will be no directory structure.
## Step 002
With this step we will introduce the possiblility to collect files inside a directory.
Different directories are not part of an other directory.

## Step 003
Now we are able to build up a tree based on directories.
